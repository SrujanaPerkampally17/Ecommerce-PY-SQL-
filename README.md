 📊 Project Workflow

 📌 1. Data Extraction & Transformation

🔹 Imported large-scale e-commerce transactional data into a SQL relational database.
🔹 Cleaned and standardized data by handling **missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent data formats.
🔹 Optimized data storage using indexes and efficient query structuring.
🔹 Created structured tables and joined datasets using **SQL joins for comprehensive analysis.

 📌 2. Business Insights Using SQL Queries

💡 Key Business Questions Answered:

✔️ Which product categories generate the most revenue?
✔️ Who are the highest-spending customers over time?
✔️ What is the average order value per customer?
✔️ How does revenue trend across different months/years?
✔️ Which sellers have the highest total sales?
✔️ What is the moving average of order values per customer?

📌 **Advanced SQL Queries Used:**

| Query Type                      | Purpose                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `GROUP BY` & `SUM()`            | Calculate total sales per category      |
| `DENSE_RANK()`                  | Rank customers based on total purchases |
| `PARTITION BY` & `ROWS BETWEEN` | Compute moving averages                 |
| `LAG()` & `LEAD()`              | Track revenue growth year-over-year     |
| `SUM() OVER(ORDER BY)`          | Calculate cumulative sales over time    |
